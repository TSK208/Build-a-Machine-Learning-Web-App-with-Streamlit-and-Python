# Build-a-Machine-Learning-Web-App-with-Streamlit-and-Python

This is a hands-on project on building your first machine learning web app with the Streamlit library in Python. By the end of this project, you are going to be comfortable with using Python and Streamlit to build beautiful and interactive ML web apps with zero web development experience.

Prior experience with writing simple Python scripts and using pandas for data manipulation is recommended. It is required that you have an understanding of Logistic Regression, Support Vector Machines, and Random Forest Classifiers and how to use them in scikit-learn.

Procedure to run the app:
Clone the repo to your PC
Go to the directory and open vs code through terminal and type in "code app.py" to open the code
Now open a new terminal in vs code, change the directory to the project directory, and run the command "streamlit run app.py"

You can have fun on your own by using different algorithms and its more fun to run the ml on web page!!
